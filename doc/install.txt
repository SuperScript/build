== System Requirements

The {package} package works only under UNIX.

== Instructions

=== Installing Under +/package+

These instructions describe an installation of a versioned distribution under
+/package+.  If you choose to install under a different prefix, replace
+/package+ with your choice of prefix in the steps that follow.

Download the {package} package.  The most recent {package} package is
link:{package}-{version}.tar.gz[{package} {version}].

If necessary, create a +/package+ directory:
!!!!
mkdir /package
chmod 1755 /package
!!!!

Unpack {package} in +/package+.
!!!!
cd /package
gunzip {package}-{version}.tar
tar -xpf {package}-{version}.tar
rm {package}-{version}.tar
cd {path}/{package}-{version}
!!!!

Follow the instructions for <<completing,completing the installation>>.

=== Installing Under A Working Copy

These instructions describe how to install to run executables from a working
copy of the repository.

Clone the repository here: https://github.com/SuperScript/{package}[{package}].
Check out the branch of your choice and +cd+ to the top-level directory.

Follow the instructions for <<completing,completing the installation>>.

=== Completing The Installation

Determine the list of directories to symlink commands into by editing the
+package/command-ln+ file.  The default is
+/package/host/superscript.com/command+.

Determine the list of directories to copy commands into by editing the
+package/command-cp+ file.  The default is none.

Compile the package:
!!!!
package/compile
!!!!
This compiles programs for the package.

Optionally copy commands into the +command/+ directory:
!!!!
package/compile it.command
!!!!


Run some tests:
!!!!
package/compile it.rts
!!!!
This will copy commands into the +command/+ directory before running tests in
case you did not do so above.  If the tests fail you will see a message
indicating where to look for more information.

Install the package.  This will compile the package if you have not already done
so:
!!!!
package/install
!!!!

Compile the documentation:
!!!!
package/docs
!!!!
This creates and populates the +www/+ directory.  It requires
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc].  The source files are located in
+doc/+ and are directly readable.  Look for files with a +.txt+ extension.


== Report Success

Email a report to the author:
!!!!
