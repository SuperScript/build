== NAME
build-db - maintain build status database

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
build-db [ -vq ] _mode_ [ mode-opts ] [ _arg_ ... ]
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +build-db+ program maintains a database of information for build targets.
It uses a configurable criterion to determine whether a target is up to date.
The link:build.html[+build+] program uses it to manage dependency tracking.

The +build-db+ program is used by the link:build.html[+build+] program.  There
is no need to call it directly.

=== THE DATABASE
The database resides in a hidden directory +.build-db/+ within the current
working directory.  This directory contains three elements:

+current/+::
A directory containing empty files indicating that a target is up to date for
purposes of the current +build+ run.

+sigprog+::
A shell script body that calculates the signature for a source file or target.
This signature determines whether the file is up to date.

+status/+::
A directory containing files that hold dependency and signature information for
source files and targets.  Files in +.build-db/+ contain status lines and
dependency lines.


A status line contains a single letter indicating the status of the file.
[horizontal]
+B+:: A target being built.
+N+:: A nonexistent file.
+S+:: A source file.
+T+:: A built target file.

A dependency line for a target has one of the following forms:
[horizontal]
+_sourcefile_ N+::
A negative dependency; the target is out of date if +_sourcefile_+
exists.
+_sourcefile_ S _sig_+::
A source file; the target is out of date if its signature has changed.
+_target_ T _sig_+::
A target file; the target is out of date if it is out of date.
+_buildfile_ M _target_ _base_+::
A makefile rule; it lists the build file and its arguments.

== OPTIONS

=== GLOBAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Decrement the verbosity level.  Print fewer status and error messages.
This option undoes the effect of +-v+ and can be used multiple times.

+-v+::
Verbose.  Increment the verbosity level.  Print more status and error messages.
This option undoes the effect of +-q+ and can be used multiple times.

=== MODES
The +build-db+ program takes a mandatory mode argument indicating the action
required.  Each mode may take additional options and arguments.  The modes are:

+check _file_+::
Check whether +_file_+ is up to date.  If it is, print +Y+ and exit 0.
Otherwise print a status indicator and return 111.  The status codes are:
[horizontal]
  +S+::: Out of date source file.
  +T+::: Out of date target.
  +N+::: Out of date file no longer exists.

+deps _target_ _dep_ ...+::
Add files to the +_target_+ dependency list.

+remove _file_+::
Remove +_file_+ from the database.

+removedb+::
Remove the entire database.

+status+::
List status for all files in the database.

+list+::
List all targets in the database.

+info+::
Show dependency info for all targets in the database.  For each target, this
prints lines containing the target, the build file and base, and each
dependency, followed by an empty line.

+init+::
Initialize for build run.  This removes all files under +.build-db/current/+.

+sigprog+::
Copy the contents of conf-sig to act as the signature program for determining
whether files are up to date.

+set_nofile _file_+::
Mark +_file_+ as nonexistent.

+set_source _file_+::
Mark +_file_+ as a source file.

+set_building _file_+::
Mark +_file_+ as a target undergoing rebuild.

+set_target _file_+::
Mark +_file_+ as a built target.

+set_makerule _target_ _buildfile_ _base_+::
Add a make rule to target record.

+help+::
Print a usage statement and a list of modes.

== EXIT STATUS
The +build+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and to indicate an
out-of-date target, and 100 for permanent errors.  It exits 0 on success.

== EXAMPLES
List the targets in the current database:
Build the target +hello.o+:
!!!!
build-db list
