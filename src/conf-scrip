This file contains a list of lines providing information about script variable
substitution.  The first blank line ends the list.  Each entry contains a type
in column 1.  Different types contain different information in subsequent
columns.  Columns are # separated.  There are two types: dep and var.  The dep
type lists dependencies for variable substitution as space-separated entries in
the second column.  The var type contains a variable name and a substitution
text used to construct a sed rule.
