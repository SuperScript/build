== NAME
build - construct targets from sources

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
build [ -vq ] _mode_ [ mode-options ] [ _arg_ ... ]
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +build+ program creates target files from source files.  It executes +sh+
scripts to create its outputs.  Rules for standard dependencies are extensible
by writing new +sh+ scripts.

== OPTIONS

=== GENERAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.  You may apply this more than once to undo
the effect of multiple +-v+ options.

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print both status and error messages.  You may apply this more than
once to increase the level of output.


=== MODES
+help+::
Print a help message.

+target _targ_ ...+::

+status+::
+list+::
+makeinfo+::
+clean+::


+-c _limit_+::
Execute at most +_limit_+ copies of +_prog_+ concurrently.  If a
trigger pull occurs while +_limit_+ copies are running,
+trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ as soon as one of the running
copies exits.

+-t _timeout_+::
Wait at most +_timeout_+ seconds for a trigger pull.  If
+_timeout_+
seconds elapse without a trigger pull, then +trigger-listen+ pulls
its own trigger.  The default value of +_timeout_+
is +(unsigned int)~0+.

+-i _interval_+::
Wait at least +_interval_+ seconds between executions of
+_prog_+.  If
it receives a trigger pull within +_interval_+ seconds of the last
execution, +trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ when
+_interval_+
seconds have elapsed.  The default value of +_interval_+ is 0.

+-g _gid_+::
Switch group ID to +_gid_+ after preparing to receive trigger pulls.

+-u _uid_+::
Switch user ID to +_uid_+ after preparing to receive connections.

+-U+::
Same as +-g $GID -u $UID+.  Typically, +$GID+ and +$UID+ are
set by http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envuidgid.html[+envuidgid+].

+-d+:: 
Delete.  Remove and recreate the fifo +_path_+ upon startup. (Default)

+-D+::
No delete.  Do not remove and recreate +_path_+ upon startup.


== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-listen+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for
permanent errors.  It exits 0 on success or when terminated by signal.


== EXAMPLES
!!!!
trigger-listen ./trigger echo \'Hello world!'
!!!!
